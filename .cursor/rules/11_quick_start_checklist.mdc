### Quick-start checklist (copy for any task)

1. Identify domain (Filters/URLs, API, SEO, SW, Security) and open key files.
2. Confirm URL canonical rules; use `parseFiltersFromUrl` and `buildCanonicalUrl*` helpers.
3. For data fetching:
   - Guard env
   - Filter undefined params → `URLSearchParams`
   - Try/catch + safe fallback
   - Consider cache wrappers
4. For pages/components touching scripts/JSON-LD:
   - Read `nonce` via `headers()` and pass to all scripts.
5. For event lists:
   - Insert ads only once on SSR
   - Respect merge and dedupe rules on client
6. If SW changes:
   - Edit template → regenerate with `prebuild`
7. Run: `yarn typecheck` → `yarn test` → `yarn lint` → build as needed.
