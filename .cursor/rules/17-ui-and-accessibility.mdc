### UI, accessibility, and styling

- Tailwind-first: Use utility classes; keep class composition simple and semantic.
- Semantics: Prefer semantic elements (<button>, <nav>, <header>, <section>) over generic <div>.
- Keyboard: Ensure focus states and keyboard navigation for interactive components.
- Images: Provide meaningful `alt`; use Next Image with sizes/quality helpers from `utils/image-quality.ts`.
- Forms: Label controls and associate `htmlFor` properly; validate before submit.
- Headless UI: Use `@headlessui/react` for accessible patterns where needed.
- Layout: Keep container widths consistent with existing responsive classes in `app/page.tsx`.
