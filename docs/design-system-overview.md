# Design System Overview

## Project: esdeveniments.cat

**Status**: ✅ Ready for Implementation  
**Estimated Effort**: 7 weeks (1 week pre-flight + 6 weeks implementation)  
**Approach**: AI-driven batch workflow with manual verification

---

## 🎯 Executive Summary

This project standardizes the Tailwind CSS implementation across 88 UI components to achieve:

- **Code consistency** - Unified semantic classes replace scattered inline utilities
- **Visual polish** - Professional shadows, spacing, and transitions (Eventbrite-level quality)
- **Maintainability** - Update design system values in one place, applies everywhere
- **Developer velocity** - Semantic classes are faster to write and easier to understand

**Key Achievement**: Transform codebase from **C+ visual quality** to **A-level professional design** while establishing clean, maintainable code patterns.

## ❌ Current Problems

### 1. Typography Chaos (80+ inconsistent patterns)

- `h1` ranges from `text-2xl` to `text-5xl`
- `h2` ranges from `text-lg` to `text-3xl`
- No semantic mapping between HTML tags and Tailwind classes
- Every developer interprets heading sizes differently

### 2. Color System Inconsistency (112 generic gray instances)

- `text-gray-600/700/800/900` instead of semantic `text-foreground`
- `bg-gray-50/100/200` instead of `bg-muted`
- `border-gray-100/200/300` instead of `border-border`
- Visual hierarchy at risk during refactors

### 3. Button Patterns (8 different implementations)

- Inconsistent padding: `py-2`, `py-3`, custom values
- Inconsistent borders: `border` vs `border-2`
- No standardized disabled states
- Hover effects vary wildly

### 4. Card Patterns (5 different variations)

- Some use `border + shadow`, others just `border` or just `shadow`
- Padding ranges from `p-4` to `p-8`
- Border radius inconsistent: `rounded-lg`, `rounded-xl`, custom

### 5. Shadow System (Almost Non-Existent)

- **Only 1 custom shadow** defined: `boxShadow.lg: "4px 4px 9px -3px #45454590"`
- Dated appearance (looks like 2015)
- No depth hierarchy
- Missing hover elevations

### 6. Spacing & Layout (No Semantic System)

- Magic numbers everywhere: `p-4`, `p-6`, `gap-2`, `gap-4`
- Repetitive patterns: `flex justify-center items-center` appears 90+ times
- No responsive spacing strategy

### 7. Transitions (No Consistency)

- Mix of `transition-all`, `transition-colors`, `transition-shadow`
- Inconsistent timing: default 150ms, `duration-200`, `duration-300`
- No standardized hover/focus states

---

## ✅ Solution Approach

### Semantic Class System

Replace descriptive Tailwind utilities with semantic, reusable classes:

**Before:**

```tsx
<h1 className="text-3xl md:text-5xl font-bold tracking-tight leading-tight font-barlow uppercase italic">
  Event Title
</h1>
```

**After:**

```tsx
<h1 className="heading-1">Event Title</h1>
```

### Professional Design Tokens (Quick Wins)

Upgrade design system values to modern, professional standards:

| Aspect            | Current        | After Quick Wins                              |
| ----------------- | -------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Shadows**       | 1 dated shadow | 7-level professional system                   |
| **Spacing**       | Random values  | 10 semantic tokens                            |
| **Transitions**   | Inconsistent   | Professional timing system                    |
| **Border Radius** | Mixed          | 5 semantic tokens                             |
| **Colors**        | Basic palette  | + Validation colors (success, error, warning) |

### Component Patterns

Standardize button, card, badge, and layout patterns:

- **Buttons**: Existing `<Button>` component will be adapted to use semantic classes in Week 4; until then use `.btn-*` classes
- **Cards**: `.card-bordered`, `.card-elevated`, `.card-body`
- **Badges**: `.badge-default`, `.badge-primary` (existing `<Badge>` component adapted in Week 4; until then use `.badge-*` classes)
- **Layout**: `.flex-center`, `.stack`, `.flex-between`, `.container-page`, `.container-article`, `.container-form`
- **Color tokens**: `background`, `foreground`, `foreground-strong`, `muted`, `border`, `primary-foreground` (legacy aliases exist during migration only)

### Deprecation & Adoption Policy

- During migration: legacy utilities permitted; semantic tokens/classes preferred.
- Week 7: remove legacy aliases no longer referenced; ensure 0 `gray-*` usages remain.
- Enforcement approach: do not disable Tailwind `gray` palette; enforce via CI/lint rules.

### Adoption Timeline & Guardrails

- Week 1: Tokens + semantic classes available; `<Button variant="...">` ready; CI allows legacy usage.
- Week 3: Error on `gray-*` in changed files; warn on repetitive flex patterns.
- Week 5: Enforce semantic buttons/cards in changed files.
- Week 7: Repo-wide enforcement; PR to remove legacy aliases.

| **Border Consistency** | B- (mixed)            | **A** ✅                     |
| **Color System**       | B (functional)        | **A** ✅                     |
| **Typography**         | B+ (good base)        | **A** ✅                     |
| **Overall Grade**      | **C+**                | **A** 🎯                     |

**Result**: Eventbrite-level professional design quality ✅

## 🤖 Implementation Approach

### AI-Driven Batch Workflow

**Process**: AI implements → User verifies → Iterate

**Batch Size**: 1-3 components per batch
**Verification**: After every batch (tests + visual QA)
**Testing**: Playwright E2E + TypeScript after each batch

**Example Batch:**

1. AI migrates 2 components
2. AI runs tests, provides output
3. User reviews changes, checks browser
4. User approves or requests adjustments
5. Repeat for next batch

**Advantages:**

- ✅ Small, verifiable changes
- ✅ Early error detection
- ✅ Continuous manual QA
- ✅ Easy rollback if needed
- ✅ No "big bang" deployment

---

## 📚 Documentation Structure

All implementation details are in **separate, focused documents**:

1. **`implementation-reference.md`** - Complete `tailwind.config.js`, `globals.css`, class reference
2. **`reference-data.md`** - Gray mapping table (112 instances), component inventory (88 components)

**This document** provides the **WHAT and WHY**. See other docs for **HOW**.

## ⚠️ Risks & Mitigation

### Risk 1: Visual Regressions

**Mitigation:**

- Screenshot comparison (Week 0 baseline)
- Playwright E2E tests after every batch
- Manual QA on 3-5 pages per batch
- Small batch sizes (1-3 components)

### Risk 2: Test Failures

**Mitigation:**

- Existing tests must pass (baseline)
- Update brittle tests (className checks)
- TypeScript check after every batch

### Risk 3: Production Hotfixes During Migration

**Mitigation:**

- Hotfix on main branch (old code)
- Deploy immediately
- Cherry-pick to migration branch
- Continue migration

### Risk 4: Team Confusion (Old vs New Patterns)

**Mitigation:**

- AI agent enforces new patterns automatically
- Quick reference guide available
- Training session in Week 6
- Code review checklist

## ❓ FAQ

### Q: Why not just use Tailwind defaults?

**A**: Project has custom brand colors (primary red `#FF0037`), custom fonts (Barlow, Roboto), and specific design language. Generic Tailwind doesn't capture these patterns.

### Q: Why semantic classes instead of inline Tailwind?

**A**:

- Faster to write (`.heading-1` vs 8 utility classes)
- Easier to maintain (update once, applies everywhere)
- Clearer intent (semantic meaning vs descriptive styles)
- Consistent application (fewer bugs)

### Q: Will this break existing components?

**A**: No. Changes are additive (new semantic classes). Old Tailwind utilities still work. Migration is gradual (batch-by-batch).

### Q: What if we need to hotfix during migration?

**A**: Hotfix on main branch (old code), deploy, then cherry-pick to migration branch. No blocking issues.

### Q: How do we prevent regression after migration?

**A**: AI agent auto-enforces design system rules (Section 20 of copilot-instructions.md). New code automatically follows patterns.

### Q: What if tests fail?

**A**: Small batches mean easy rollback. AI identifies issue, proposes fix, user approves. Iterate until tests pass.

### Q: Can we skip Quick Wins?

**A**: Technically yes, but not recommended. Quick Wins transform visual quality (C+ → A) with only 3 hours of work in Week 1.
